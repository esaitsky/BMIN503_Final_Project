# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

Objective: Evaluate the significance of TMRPSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer. 

- Significance is defined as presence of TMRPSS2-ERG fusion and correlation with more aggressive disease and/or disease that is more likely to reoccur. 
- Aggressive disease and/or disease that is more likely to reoccur will be identified via quantitative analysis of known diagnostic and prognostic markers found in the dataset
- GOAL: Assess whether presence of TMRPSS2-ERG fusion is likely to inform clinical care.

Have pulled in a dataset from the BROAD Institute and access dataset via CBioPortal

-	Analyzed N=112 patient samples https://www.cbioportal.org/study/clinicalData?id=prad_broad
-	Used PCA, Bootstrapping, Linear Model, Random Forest, Lasso preferred predictors
-	Hypothesis that TMRPSS2 can be used to predict aggressivness of disease was proven false

Main Finding
-	Takeaway: TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion Status cannot be used to predict aggressiveness of disease, as defined by the composite score comprised of FGA Status, TBM, and GleaScore.
